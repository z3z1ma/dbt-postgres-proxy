dbt-pg-proxy
================

A reverse proxy for postgres which compiles queries in flight using a dbt rpc server. This is both a PoC as well as a dev tool that allows rapid prototying dbt models directly from any tool which is capable of connecting to Postgres. Think dbeaver, datagrip, BI tools, SQLAlchemy, etc.

Failure to rewrite the query will raise a NOTICE but it will not cause an error. It is likely in invalidly compiled dbt query will not be accepted by the database

All other messages than Query are passed to the upstream unmodified. SSL connections are not supported.
